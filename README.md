💘 Interactive Valentine Website

My First Web Development Project
🔗 Live Demo

This was my first hands-on web project—a fun, interactive Valentine’s Day proposal website designed to practice core front-end skills. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site lets users create playful, personalised messages to ask:
“Will you be my Valentine?”

✨ Features:
	•	🎨 Custom Themes & Animations – Switch between romantic and friendly modes
	•	📝 Editable Prompts – Users can input custom messages and trigger surprise pop-ups
	•	📱 Responsive Design – Optimised for both mobile and desktop

💡 What I Learned:

This project introduced me to the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling, while giving me hands-on experience in creating an interactive user experience. It laid the foundation for my passion for front-end development and creative UI design.
