💘 Interactive Valentine Website – My First Web Development Project
This was my very first hands-on web project—an interactive, personalized Valentine’s Day proposal site designed to practice and showcase front-end skills. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website allows users to create a playful, memorable way to ask: “Will you be my Valentine?”

It includes:
	•	🎨 Custom themes & animations for romantic or friendly proposals
	•	📝 Editable message prompts and surprise pop-ups
	•	📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop

What started as a fun idea quickly became a practical learning experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, styling, and basic UX design. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of web interactivity and sparked my interest in frontend development.
